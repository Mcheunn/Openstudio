# Overview
As of April 2020, development and distribution of the OpenStudioApplication and the SketchUp plugin have transitioned to the OpenStudio Coalition, who is independently managing and distributing the software through its own [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) repository. The OpenStudio SDK is continuing to be actively developed and distributed by NREL and is released two times per year, through a spring and a fall release. 

Below is the list of components that is included in this SDK installer:

__**OpenStudio SDK 3.1.0**__
- EnergyPlus
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Radiance
- Ruby API
- C++ SDK

**Note** that [PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) is not included in either the SDK or the OpenStudio Coalition's Application installers. You will need to install PAT separately which is distributed on the [OpenStudio-PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) GitHub page.

# Where to Find OpenStudio SDK Documentation

- OpenStudio SDK release documentation, including these release notes, tutorials, and other user documentation, is available at [https://www.openstudio.net/](https://www.openstudio.net/.)

- A roadmap for planned features is available at http://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/getting_started/roadmap/.

# Installation Notes

OpenStudio SDK 3.1.0 is supported on 64-bit Windows 7 – 10, OS X 10.14 – 10.15, and Ubuntu 18.04.

OpenStudio SDK 3.1.0 supports [EnergyPlus Release 9.4](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v9.4.0), which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer. It is no longer necessary to download and install EnergyPlus separately. Other builds of EnergyPlus are not supported by OpenStudio SDK 3.1.0.

OpenStudio SDK 3.1.0 supports Radiance 5.0.a.12, which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer; users no longer must install Radiance separately, and OpenStudio will use the included Radiance version regardless of any other versions that may be installed on the system. Other builds of Radiance are not supported by OpenStudio SDK 3.1.0.

OpenStudio SDK 3.x now uses **Ruby 2.5.5** as the supported version (2.2.4 previously).

As usual, you can refer to the **[OpenStudio SDK Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/OpenStudio-Version-Compatibility-Matrix)** for more information.


## Installation Steps

- Download and install [OpenStudio SDK](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio) and/or [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) depending on your needs. Select components for installation. Note that OpenStudio Application is a standalone app and does not require you to install OpenStudio SDK.
- Setup a Building Component Library (BCL) account to access online building components and measures. View instructions on how to setup your account and configure the key in OpenStudio.
- The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in requires SketchUp 2019 (not available for Linux). The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in does not support older versions of SketchUp. SketchUp must be installed before OpenStudio Application to automatically activate the plugin. If you install SketchUp after OpenStudio Application, simply rerun the OpenStudio Application installer.

# OpenStudio SDK: Changelog

The 3.1.0 is a major release. This update includes several new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes.
You can find the list of Pull Requests that got into this release [here](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+created%3A2020-04-28..2020-10-15+).


## New Features, Major Fixes and API-breaking changes

A number of API-breaking changes have been implemented in OpenStudio SDK 3.1.0:

* [#3960](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/3960) - Added support for building the C# bindings via `dotnet` CLI, including on Unix platforms
* [#3966](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/3966) - Closes [#3945](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/issues/3945) - Support the EnergyPlus object SurfaceControl:MovableInsulation which can be used to add insulation surface(s) on top of opaque surfaces, such as a transparent coating that affects the radiative gains to a roof surface
* [#3959](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/3959) - Also included some improvements in the generated C# bindings by reducing build warnings and properly exposing some types via SWIG
    * `ScheduleTypeKey` (which is normally only use by OpenStudio internals in ScheduleTypeRegistry checks) previously mapped to a `std::pair<std::string, std::string>` which was SWIGed in ruby as an Array of strings of size two, but improperly exposed in C#. It now uses a dedicated helper class with two methods `ScheduleTypeKey::className()` and `ScheduleTypeKey::scheduleDisplayName()`
* [#3987](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/3987) - Closes [#3907](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/issues/3907) - Support new Coil:Cooling:DX, Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:Performance, Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:OperatingMode, Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:Speed objects
* [#4009](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4009) - Closes [#4006](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/issues/4006) - Add SwimmingPool:Indoor to SDK
* [#4050](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4050) - Fixes [#3921](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/issues/3921) - Some children of RefrigerationSystem can be added several times and produce a fatal when System is removed
    * `RefrigerationSystem` will now be enforcing unicity for all children. This was already the case for a few of the child objects such as Case and WalkIns, it is now the case for all objects (`RefrigerationCondenserCascade`, `RefrigerationSubcoolerMechanical` and `RefrigerationSubcoolerLiquidSuction`, etc.). What this means is that setter methods (or add methods in case of a list) will remove the child for any current RefrigerationSystem it is on first.
* [#4066](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4066) - Multiple shading controls referenced by a single subsurface
    * `SubSurface` was historically the one referencing the `ShadingControl` object. Now it's a many-to-many relationship where `ShadingControl` has an extensible 'Sub Surface Name' field, and multiple `ShadingControl` objects can reference the same `SubSurface`. This is trickling down from a change introduced in EnergyPlus version 9.4, and specifically in PR [NREL/EnergyPlus#8196](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/8196)
    * Methods in `SubSurface` have been deprecated but are kept for backward compatibility. They will be removed in a future version of OpenStudio:
        * `shadingControl()`: prefer `shadingControls()`
        * `setShadingControl(ShadingControl&)`: use `addShadingControl(SubSurface&)`, `addShadingControls(std::vector<SubSurface>&)` or `setShadingControls(std::vector<SubSurface>&)`
        * `resetShadingControl()`: use `removeAllShadingControls()` instead
    * All Shading Control Type values should now be supported. Refer to issue [#4074](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/issues/4074) for more information
    * Fields 'Glare Control Is Active', 'Type of Slat Angle Control for Blinds', 'Slat Angle Schedule Name', 'Setpoint2', and 'Multiple Surface Control Type' are now implemented as well
* [#4026](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4026) - Fix OpenStudio Windows crashed during save attempt
* [#4028](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4028) - Fixes [#3835](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/issues/3835) - Decrease overall load time of CLI and lazy load OpenStudio ruby bindings when possible
* [#4059](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4059) - Add new OutputControl:Files object to SDK, which allows conditionally turning on/off output from EnergyPlus
* [#4101](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4101) - Update EnergyPlus v940 official
