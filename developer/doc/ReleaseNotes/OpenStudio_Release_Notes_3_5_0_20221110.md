As of April 2020, development and distribution of the OpenStudioApplication and the SketchUp plugin have transitioned to the OpenStudio Coalition, who is independently managing and distributing the software through its own [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) repository. The OpenStudio SDK is continuing to be actively developed and distributed by NREL and is released two times per year, through a spring and a fall release.

Below is the list of components that is included in this SDK installer:

__**OpenStudio SDK 3.5.0**__
- EnergyPlus
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Radiance
- Ruby API
- C++ SDK

**Note** that [PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) is not included in either the SDK or the OpenStudio Coalition's Application installers. You will need to install PAT separately which is distributed on the [OpenStudio-PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) GitHub page.

# Installation Notes

OpenStudio SDK 3.5.0 is supported on 64-bit Windows 7 â€“ 11, OS X 10.15, Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and Centos7

OpenStudio SDK 3.5.0 supports [EnergyPlus Release 22.1.0](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v22.1.0), which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer. It is no longer necessary to download and install EnergyPlus separately. Other builds of EnergyPlus are not supported by OpenStudio SDK 3.5.0.

OpenStudio SDK 3.5.0 supports Radiance 5.0.a.12, which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer; users no longer must install Radiance separately, and OpenStudio will use the included Radiance version regardless of any other versions that may be installed on the system. Other builds of Radiance are not supported by OpenStudio SDK 3.5.0.

As usual, you can refer to the **[OpenStudio SDK Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/OpenStudio-SDK-Version-Compatibility-Matrix)** for more information.


## Installation Steps

- Download and install [OpenStudio SDK](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio) and/or [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) depending on your needs. Select components for installation. Note that OpenStudio Application is a standalone app and does not require you to install OpenStudio SDK.
- Setup a Building Component Library (BCL) account to access online building components and measures. View instructions on how to setup your account and configure the key in OpenStudio.
- The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in requires SketchUp 2021-2022 (not available for Linux). The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in does not support older versions of SketchUp. SketchUp must be installed before OpenStudio Application to automatically activate the plugin. If you install SketchUp after OpenStudio Application, simply re-run the OpenStudio Application installer.

## New Features, Major Fixes and API-breaking changes


* [#4689](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4689),[#4702](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4702),[#4694](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4694),[#4674](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4674),[#4641](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4641),[#4688](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4688),[#4653](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4653) - Phase 1 support to run Python based measures. 
    * Currently, this functionality is experimental and can only be accessed from the CLI using the experimental `labs` subcommand. This also includes a redesigned help menu (`openstudio labs --help`) to explore the various new options this new feature has to offer. 
    * Included in the installation are example .osw workflow files that contain Python based measures that can be ran using the labs subcommand. For instance, the following will run a python based workflow.   
`openstudio run -w ./Examples/compact_osw/compact_python_only.osw` 

    * For this release, only Python or Ruby can be ran in a single workflow file. Running both Python and Ruby support is planned for the next phase 2 installment in v3.6.0

* [#4600](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4600) - Phase 1 support to run Python EMS plugin using OpenStudio.

* [#4623](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4623) - FloorspaceJS to OpenStudio direct reverse translator vs the 3-way process of converting FloorspaceJS to ThreeJS to OSM. 

* [#4571](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4571) - Metadata mapped to GLTF data object at export. Allows users to view metadata in a glTF capable browser. 

* [#4587](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4587) - Error handling and gbXML schema validation when running gbXML based workflows. 

* [#4616](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4616) - Addresses #4611, allow non-Quadratic curves for the EIR-f-PLR for the Chiller:Electric:EIR object
    * `Chiller:Electric:EIR` has a few API-breaking changes related to its Curves. The types for the constructor, getters and setters used to be explicit (eg: `CurveBiquadratic`): it is now the base class, more generic, `Curve` type for added flexibility.
* [#4642](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4642) - Addresses #4575, API change for EvaporativeCoolerFluid:SingleSpeed
    * `EvaporativeCoolerFluid:SingleSpeed` has an API-breaking change related to its `performanceInputMethod` getter. It is now a required field that returns `std::string` instead of `boost::optional<std::string>`.
* [#4644](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4644) - Addresses #4575, API change for Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed and Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed
    * `Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed` and `Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed` have API-breaking changes related to many of their getters. They are now required fields that return `double` instead of `boost::optional<double>`. Also removes many deprecated methods.
* [#4632](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4632) - Remove deprecated methods for AirWallMaterial, Node, SizingSystem, ZoneAirMassFlowConservation
    * Removes the deprecated `AirWallMaterial` class completely, in favor of `ConstructionAirBoundary`
    * Removes functions in `Node` that have been deprecated for 9+ years
    * Removes deprecated methods in the `SizingSystem`, `ZoneAirMassFlowConservation`, `PlantLoop` & `AirLoopHVAC`, `AvailablilityManagerNightCycle`, `ZoneVentilationDesignFlowRate` classes
    * Refer to the CSV file at [developer/ruby/deprecated_methods.csv](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/blob/develop/developer/ruby/deprecated_methods.csv) for more information
* [#4665](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4665) - Deprecate methods on Coil DX objects
    * `Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed`, `Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed:StageData`, and `Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:Speed`: `ratedEvaporatorFanPowerPerVolumeFlowRate` and `setRatedEvaporatorFanPowerPerVolumeFlowRate` in favor of `ratedEvaporatorFanPowerPerVolumeFlowRate2017` and `setRatedEvaporatorFanPowerPerVolumeFlowRate2017`
    * `Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed` and `Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed:StageData`: `ratedSupplyFanPowerPerVolumeFlowRate` and `setRatedSupplyFanPowerPerVolumeFlowRate` in favor of `ratedSupplyFanPowerPerVolumeFlowRate2017` and `setRatedSupplyFanPowerPerVolumeFlowRate2017`
* [#4666](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4666) - Changes related to availability schedule methods
    * `Coil:Heating:Gas:MultiStage` has an API-breaking change related to its `availabilitySchedule` getter. It is now a required field that returns `Schedule` instead of `boost::optional<Schedule>`. Method `resetAvailabilitySchedule` is also removed.
* [#4701](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4701) - `ZoneHVACPackagedTerminalAirConditioner` and `ZoneHVACPackagedTerminalHeatPump`
    * `ZoneHVACPackagedTerminalAirConditioner` and `ZoneHVACPackagedTerminalHeatPump` have an API-breaking change related to its `supplyAirFanOperatingModeSchedule` getter. It is now a required field that returns `Schedule` instead of `boost::optional<Schedule>`. Method `resetSupplyAirFanOperatingModeSchedule` is also removed.
        * It is set to `alwaysOnDiscreteSchedule` (=Constant) in the Constructor if you provide a `FanConstantVolume` (This is **required** by E+)
        * It is set to `alwaysOffDiscreteSchedule` (=Cycling) in the Constructor if you provide any other fan types (E+ treats a blank schedule as always off)
    * There are unusual `VersionTranslator` Rules for Packaged Systems (PTAC or PTHP) that use a `FanConstantVolume` and that do not have a `Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule`. In 22.1.0 this would effectively, and mistakenly, function as a cycling fan, but this is now disallowed in E+ 22.2.0. In order to retain a similar functionality and energy usage, the `FanConstantVolume` will be replaced by a `FanSystemModel` with an Always Off Schedule (=cycling fan, similar to a `Fan:OnOff`), mapping inputs such as pressure rise and efficiency appropriately.
