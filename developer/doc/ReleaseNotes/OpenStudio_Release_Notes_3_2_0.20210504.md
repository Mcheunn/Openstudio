# Overview
As of April 2020, development and distribution of the OpenStudioApplication and the SketchUp plugin have transitioned to the OpenStudio Coalition, who is independently managing and distributing the software through its own [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) repository. The OpenStudio SDK is continuing to be actively developed and distributed by NREL and is released two times per year, through a spring and a fall release.

Below is the list of components that is included in this SDK installer:

__**OpenStudio SDK 3.2.0**__
- EnergyPlus
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Radiance
- Ruby API
- C++ SDK

**Note** that [PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) is not included in either the SDK or the OpenStudio Coalition's Application installers. You will need to install PAT separately which is distributed on the [OpenStudio-PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) GitHub page.

# Installation Notes

OpenStudio SDK 3.2.0 is supported on 64-bit Windows 7 – 10, OS X 10.14 – 10.15, and Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04

OpenStudio SDK 3.2.0 supports [EnergyPlus Release 9.5](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v9.5.0), which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer. It is no longer necessary to download and install EnergyPlus separately. Other builds of EnergyPlus are not supported by OpenStudio SDK 3.2.0.

OpenStudio SDK 3.2.0 supports Radiance 5.0.a.12, which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer; users no longer must install Radiance separately, and OpenStudio will use the included Radiance version regardless of any other versions that may be installed on the system. Other builds of Radiance are not supported by OpenStudio SDK 3.2.0.

OpenStudio SDK 3.2.0 now uses **Ruby 2.7.2** as the supported version (2.5.5 previously in the 3.x series, and 2.2.4 for 2.x series).



As usual, you can refer to the **[OpenStudio SDK Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/OpenStudio-SDK-Version-Compatibility-Matrix)** for more information.


## Installation Steps

- Download and install [OpenStudio SDK](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio) and/or [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) depending on your needs. Select components for installation. Note that OpenStudio Application is a standalone app and does not require you to install OpenStudio SDK.
- Setup a Building Component Library (BCL) account to access online building components and measures. View instructions on how to setup your account and configure the key in OpenStudio.
- The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in requires SketchUp 2019 (not available for Linux). The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in does not support older versions of SketchUp. SketchUp must be installed before OpenStudio Application to automatically activate the plugin. If you install SketchUp after OpenStudio Application, simply rerun the OpenStudio Application installer.

## Update to Ruby 2.7.2

OpenStudio SDK now comes with Ruby 2.7.2 ([#4207](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4207)) which provides many improvements over the previous version, v2.5.5, such as pattern matching, REPL improvement, compaction GC, separation of positional and keyword arguments, and security related improvements. 

To see the full list of Ruby updates and improvements, please refer to the official [ruby release notes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/releases/). 

## Python Bindings 

New for OpenStudio SDK is support for Python bindings ( [#4122](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4122)). OpenStudio users can now use the popular Python Programming language across supported platforms to interface with OpenStudio SDK. Users can install the bindings using the Python package tool called pip. To install, users will need to have Python3 installed along with pip and simply run the following command in a terminal window. 

`pip install openstudio==3.2.0` 

 Please see [openstudio on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/openstudio/) for further instructions on how to install. Users can also visit the test channel at https://test.pypi.org/project/openstudio/ to install development bindings.

    * A default `ElectricLoadCenterDistribution` is no longer instantiated in the constructor of children objects: `GeneratorFuelCell`, `GeneratorMicroTurbine`, `GeneratorPhotovoltaic`, `GeneratorPVWatts`

* [#4153](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4153) - Fix #3532 #4152 - Make heating/cooling coils optional for ZoneHVACLowTempVariableFlow and add missing fields to coils
    * This is an API breaking change, the coils are now optional so the getters have been modified to account for this.
    ```diff
    - HVACComponent heatingCoil() const;
    + boost::optional<HVACComponent> heatingCoil() const;
